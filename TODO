- Use UCSC.utils and get rid of R/UCSC-utils.R. Also remove
  man/list_UCSC_genomes.Rd and go thru every occurences of
  list_UCSC_genomes in the other man pages to fix links/redirections.

- Deprecate makeFeatureDbFromUCSC(), supportedUCSCFeatureDb*(), and
  UCSCFeatureDbTableSchema() in BioC 3.20. Not a single Bioconductor
  package is using this. Then defunct in BioC 3.21. Once defunct, we
  can get rid of rtracklayer dependency.

- makeTxDbFromUCSC(): Address the CDS non-completeness issue.
  The status of the CDS (complete or not) can be inferred from the
  cds*Stat field (when present) of the UCSC table.
